                <td>Among the things you did not know about Spider-Man, surely there is the following: Tobey Maguire was not the first. Before the actor donned the suit in Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004) and Spider-Man 3 (2007), Nicholas Hammond had already done so for the Spider-Man series (1977-1979). However, Tobey Maguire is the first actor to play Spider-Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which began in the 2000s.</td>
                <td>Tobey Maguire played Peter Parker, the young orphaned high school student who lives with his Aunt May in the New York borough of Queens. The movie was well received, but the biggest fans of Marvel comics pointed out that Spider-Man doesn't shoot webs, but instead builds his gadgets with technology to launch them. Throughout the trilogy he maintains a romance story with his neighbor Mary Jane Watson, played by Kirsten Dunst. And the enemies he faces are the Green Goblin, Doctor Octopus and Venom.</td>
                <td>After the superheroes in the cinema had gained momentum, they began to make movies of other characters such as Iron Man, Hulk, The Avengers or Captain America. And after five years without knowing anything about the arachnid superhero, Marvel announced that Andrew Garfield would play Spider-Man this time</td>
